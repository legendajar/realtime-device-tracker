# Real Time Device Tracker

## Project Overview

This is the real time device tracker application which shows the real time location of the two or more devices simultaneously. This functionality can be added in various applications like OLA, Uber, Zomato, Swiggy etc.
This is the basic application for understanding the concept of socket io as well as the map functionalities of these applications.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Instant updates of device locations on the map.
Bidirectional communication using Socket.IO for real-time data exchange.

- **Device Management:**:Add, update, and remove devices.Unique identification for each device.

- **Geolocation:**:Integration with geolocation services (e.g., GPS, IP-based geolocation).

- **Map Integration:**:Integration with mapping services (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap).Display device locations on an interactive map. Real-time updates of device positions on the map.

- **User Interface:**:Intuitive and responsive UI for managing devices and viewing their locations.Real-time notifications for device status changes.Customizable dashboards and views.

## Technologies Used

- **NodeJS:** Backend framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS:** Styling for a clean and responsive design.
- **SocketIo:** It is a library for real-time web applications that enables bi-directional communication between web clients and servers
